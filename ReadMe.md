# 5 Stage MIPS Processor
Cycle accurate model of a 5 stage processor implementing the MIPS ISA, implemented in Verilog
* Pipelined with fast branching and non-pipelined versions

Test C code programs, cross-compiled for MIPS producing machine code loadable into the memory model for execution during RTL simulation.
